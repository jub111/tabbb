# tabbbs

### *tabbbs* is a tiny chrome extension that makes browsing on dribbble more comfortable.

Infinite scrolling can cause some hiccups when you navigate back and forth in your browser. By default, user profiles and links in shot descriptions are opened in the same tab - if want to go back to the feed after opening such a link, you often don't end up at the previous scroll position.

With *tabbbs* you can choose to open all user profiles and links in shot descriptions in a new tab by default, so that always get back to where you took off.
